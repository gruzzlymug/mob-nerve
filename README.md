# Mob Nerve
ACF Nov 23

Another C++ Frankensystem. A proof of concept integrating a few systems to build some kind of game-like pipeline.

Graphics and Audio provided by [SDL 2](http://www.libsdl.org/).

## Notes
Developed with VS Code for convenience. Maybe I have given up on ViM, etc., at least for now.

## Dependencies
Requires SDL 2 to be installed in local INCLUDE and LIB directories (e.g. /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib).
